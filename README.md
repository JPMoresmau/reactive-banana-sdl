===================

reactive banana bindings for SDL

[Reactive-banana](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Reactive-banana) is a Functional Reactive Programming library to write UI programs in a functional way.

[SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](http://www.libsdl.org/) is a cross platform library for low level access to audio, graphics and input devices, used a lot for games. There are [bindings](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SDL) for Haskell.

Reactive-banana-sdl puts both together! It provides an event loop from SDL events and combinators for pure SDL graphics.
